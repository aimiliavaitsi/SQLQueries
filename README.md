# ðŸ“˜ SQL Practice Queries

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries I wrote while completing various SQL courses. All exercises were done using PostgreSQL.

The queries cover a wide range of SQL concepts, including:

## ðŸ”¹ Topics Covered:

Basic Filtering â€“ WHERE, BETWEEN, LIKE, logical operators

Grouping and Aggregation â€“ GROUP BY, HAVING, aggregate functions

Joins â€“ INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN

Subqueries â€“ simple subqueries inside SELECT, FROM, or WHERE clauses

Correlated Subqueries â€“ subqueries that reference columns from the outer query

Window Functions â€“ RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), OVER(), PARTITION BY

SQL Functions â€“ text, date/time, numeric, and conditional functions

Database Manipulation â€“ CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP

These scripts are for learning and practice purposes and reflect my progress as I developed my SQL skills.
